Version 0.5.2 (2013-01-06):
===========================
* Fixed path of the autstart file
* Minor other fixes


Version 0.5.1 (2012-12-23):
===========================
* Restored translated strings (previously available in mailnag <= 0.4.3)
  that were removed due to a bug in the gen_po_template script
* Fixed a race condition that can lead to mutliple mailnag instances


Version 0.5.0 (2012-12-05):
===========================
* Bugfix: (really) don't crash on session start 
  if the notification DBUS interface isn't available yet

* Removed evolution account import (not working anymore)
* Minor other fixes

IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - Packagers should incorporate the new dependecy list.
  - The new keyring binding stores credentials in ~/.local/share/keyrings 
    instead of in ~/.gnome2/keyrings. So you probably have to fire up 
    mailnag_config and re-enter your mail account password(s).
