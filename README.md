## An extensible mail notification daemon

Mailnag is a daemon program that checks POP3 and IMAP servers for new mail.  
On mail arrival it performs various actions provided by plugins.  
Mailnag comes with a set of desktop-independent default plugins for  
visual/sound notifications, script execution etc. and can be extended  
with additional plugins easily.

Run `sudo apt-get install mailnag` in a terminal to install it.

Just run `yum install mailnag` (as root) in a terminal to install the package.

### Arch Linux

Please run `pacman -Syu mailnag` (as root) to install the package.

### Void Linux
Mailnag is available in the official repos.  
Run `xbps-install -S mailnag` (as root) in a terminal to install the package.  
Read `/usr/share/doc/mailnag/README.voidlinux` after install for further information.

### openSUSE
Mailnag is available in openSUSE Tumbleweed.  
Run `sudo zypper install mailnag` in a terminal to install it.

### Generic Tarballs
Distribution independent tarball releases are available [here](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/releases).  
Just run `./setup.py install` (as root) to install Mailnag,  
though make sure the requirements stated below are met.

###### Requirements
* python (>= 3.5)
* pygobject
* gir-notify (>= 0.7.6)
* gir-gtk-3.0
* gir-gdkpixbuf-2.0
* gir-glib-2.0
* gir-gst-plugins-base-1.0
* python-dbus
* pyxdg
* gettext
* gir1.2-secret-1 (optional)


## Configuration
Run `mailnag-config` to setup Mailnag.  
Closing the configuration window will start Mailnag automatically.

### Default Mail Client
Clicking a mail notification popup will open the default mail client specified in `GNOME Control Center -> Details -> Default Applications`.  
If you're a webmail (e.g. gmail) user and want your account to be launched in a browser, please install a tool like [gnome-gmail](http://gnome-gmail.sourceforge.net).

### Desktop Integration
By default, Mailnag emits libnotify notifications, which work fine on most desktop environments  
but are visible for a few seconds only. If you like to have a tighter desktop integration  
(e.g. a permanently visible indicator in your top panel) you have to install an appropriate  
extension/plugin for your desktop shell. Currently the following desktop shells are supported:  
* GNOME-Shell ([GNOME-Shell extension](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-gnome-shell))  
* KDE ([Plasma 5 applet by driglu4it](https://store.kde.org/p/1420222/))  
* Cinnamon ([Applet by hyOzd](https://bitbucket.org/hyOzd/mailnagapplet))  
* Elementary Pantheon ([MessagingMenu plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-messagingmenu-plugin))  
* XFCE ([MessagingMenu plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-messagingmenu-plugin))  
  
Furthermore, I highly recommend GNOME users to install the [GOA plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-goa-plugin),  
which makes Mailnag aware of email accounts specified in GNOME Online Accounts.  

### Troubleshooting

__Gmail doesn't work__  
If Mailnag is unable to connect to your Gmail account, please try the following solutions:
* Install the [GOA plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-goa-plugin) to connect via GNOME online accounts
* Have a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/wiki/FAQ)
* Try to apply [this](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/issues/190) workaround

__Other issues__  
If Mailnag doesn't work properly for you, either examine the system log for errors (`journalctl -b _COMM=mailnag`)
or run `mailnag` in a terminal and observe the output.
