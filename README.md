# Mailnag
An extensible mail notification daemon.  

Mailnag is a daemon program that checks POP3 and IMAP servers for new mail.  
On mail arrival it performs various actions provided by plugins.  
Mailnag comes with a set of desktop-independent default plugins for  
visual/sound notifications, script execution etc. and can be extended  
with additional plugins easily.

### Generic Tarballs
Distribution independent tarball releases are available [here](https://launchpad.net/mailnag/trunk/mailnag-master).  
Just run `./setup.py install` (as root) to install Mailnag,  
though make sure the requirements stated below are met.

###### Requirements
* python2 (python3 won't work!)
* pygobject
* gir-notify (>= 0.7.6)
* gir-gtk-3.0
* gir-gdkpixbuf-2.0
* gir-glib-2.0
* gir-gst-plugins-base-1.0
* gir-gnomekeyring-1.0
* python-httplib2
* python-dbus
* pyxdg
* gettext


## Configuration
Run `mailnag-config` to setup Mailnag.  
Closing the configuration window will start Mailnag automatically.

### Default Mail Client
Clicking a mail notification popup will open the default mail client specified in `System Settings -> System Info -> Default Applications`.  
If you're a webmail (e.g. gmail) user and want your account to be launched in a browser, please install a tool like [gnome-gmail](http://gnome-gmail.sourceforge.net).

### Desktop integration
By default, Mailnag emits libnotify notifications, which work fine on most desktop environments  
but are visible for a few seconds only. If you like to have a tighter desktop integration  
(e.g. a permanently visible indicator in your top panel) you have to install an appropriate  
extension/plugin for your desktop shell. Currently the following desktop shells are supported:  
* GNOME-Shell ([GNOME-Shell extension](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-gnome-shell))  
* Ubuntu Unity ([MessagingMenu plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-unity-plugin))
