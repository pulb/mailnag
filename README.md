### Generic Tarballs
Distribution independent tarball releases are available [here](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/downloads).

though make sure the requirements stated below are met.

###### Requirements
* python2 (python3 won't work!)

* gir-glib-2.0
* gir-gnomekeyring-1.0
* python-httplib2

## Configuration
Run `mailnag_config` to setup Mailnag.  
Closing the configuration window will start Mailnag automatically.

### Default Mail Client
Clicking a mail notification popup will open the default mail client specified in `System Settings -> System Info -> Default Applications`.  
If you're a webmail (e.g. gmail) user and want your account to be launched in a browser, please install a tool like [gnome-gmail](http://gnome-gmail.sourceforge.net).

### Permanent Notifications
GNOME-Shell notifications are visible for a few seconds only before they vanish in GNOME's hidden messaging tray.  
If you like to have a permanently visible notification counter in your top panel, you probably want to install [this](https://github.com/pulb/shell-message-notifier) GNOME-Shell extension.
